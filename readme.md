Focus on the core CRUD functionality and basic role-based authentication. Leave advanced features like templates and version history for future iterations.

MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

1. Users can log in/sign up with different roles (e.g., admin, clinician, assistant).

2. Notes can be:

    Created, edited, deleted, and viewed.

    Assigned to specific users.

3. Implement role-based permissions:

    Only specific roles can edit or delete a note.

4. Basic file upload for PDF or images (store in a database or local directory).



Stretch Features (For Future Iterations):

    Version history of notes.

    Selectable templates.

    Search and filter functionality.


Why This Level? It’s enough to showcase backend skills like role-based authentication, file handling, and CRUD operations, which are core skills for a backend developer. You won’t get bogged down in advanced features like versioning, which can be complex for a junior.
